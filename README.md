I am a **Telecommunications Engineer with a Masterâ€™s in Network Engineering and Telematic Services**. I currently work as Software Developer in Ericsson, doing automation tasks and analysing data in 5G network structures.

Python and JavaScript are my favourites coding languages, but I have also worked with React, C++, Angular and other technologies.
